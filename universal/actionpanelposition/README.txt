This example program illustrates differences in appearance of action/ringmenu 
panels between Native on various devices and Universal on those same devices

Key things to observe :-

The first menu when no window is present.  On Mobile Devices menu is rendered
like a DISPLAY ARRAY. Under Universal appears in action/ringmenu panel

Pay attention to the appearance of actions that have text, image only, or both
text and image defined.  On native mobile, these would appear as image only

Note the appearance of the cancel action, on native mobile would render as
< on iOS which might include title of window going back to, or be implemented
via back button on Android.  With Universal appears in action/ringmenu panel

Note the overflow beheaviour

Note the ability to position action panel top/left/bottom/right

With universal, no transition effects.
